            "detailed_description": "The Pelvic Cradle is a specialized seating system designed to provide superior pelvic support and positioning. It features a flexible adjustment mechanism in the back section that encourages a posteriorly tilted pelvis into a neutral alignment, which is crucial for maintaining proper posture and reducing the risk of pressure ulcers. The overall design prevents users from sliding forward, ensuring that the pelvis remains in the optimal position. This cradle is particularly beneficial for individuals with complex body shapes or those who require additional support to maintain proper pelvic alignment.",
